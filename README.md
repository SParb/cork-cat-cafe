## About

The Cork Cat Cafe is a unique destination where guests can sip coffee, enjoy delicious food, and spend time with adorable resident cats. Whether you're a cat enthusiast or simply looking for a cozy spot to relax, our cafe offers the perfect setting.

## Project Planning

To ensure smooth development, we followed these steps and milestones:

- **User Stories:**
  - I want a user-friendly design and a website that looks great on all screen sizes, so I can quickly find the information I need without frustration.
  - I want a strong first impression, with a hero page that grabs my attention.
  - I want to know the cat cafe's location, phone number, email address, and social media pages so I can learn more about the cafe.
  - I want a dedicated gallery page to see the cats who live at the cafe.
  - I want to be able to book a time to visit a specific cat.
  - I want a quick way to send direct feedback or questions about the cat cafe.
  - I want to see prices, menu options, and opening times directly on the homepage.

- **Design:** Created wireframes and mockups for the site layout using Balsamiq, focusing on accessibility and visual appeal. (Wireframes presented below)
